# The Ongoing Construction of a Digital Portfolio

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

# What was your motivation?
My motivation behind this project was to create a webpage from scratch as a demonstration of ability and understanding of HTML and CSS.
# Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
A portfolio is a demonstration of ability for potential employers. A webpage serving as a portfolio for a web developer is a no-brainer. The page itself is a demonstration, and it includes links to other projects within it.
# What problem does it solve?
This project serves as a portfolio that can and will be altered in the future as projects are completed to replace the placeholder images and links, as well as develop a more appealing design. A portfolio is an important resource in a job search as one's most impressive work can all be displayed and accessed on a single page that an employer can view.
# What did you learn?
I learned that appealing page design is harder than it looks. The aim was functionality over form; although, obivously, ideally they are both present. That is, of course, what makes an effective webpage. While the functionality was accomplished as requested by the parameters of the assignment, the form needs a significant amount of work. While doing the project, I had to learn while working how to add internal links within a page. I knew external links; internal links were new to me. I also had to learn how to make images into external links. The most challenging part was design. I ultimately floundered on this aspect.
